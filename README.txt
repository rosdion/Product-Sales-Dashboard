# 🛍️ Product Sales Dashboard

An AI-enhanced, interactive data visualization project that analyzes product sales from promotional listings. Built with a blend of web scraping, data cleaning, and frontend dashboard design using React and Recharts.

## 📌 Project Overview

This dashboard visualizes eCommerce product data (such as pricing, category, and sales volume) scraped from a promotional webpage. It helps identify trends in product popularity, price sensitivity, and category dominance.

> 🔥 **Highlight Insight:**  
> The Vxe Dragonfly Gaming Mouse outsold all others (910K units), likely driven by its low price of $10.00 — a strong example of price-conversion sensitivity.
